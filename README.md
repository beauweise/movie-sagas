# MOVIE SAGAS
Description
Duration: 4 day Sprint


The app that I created allows you to select from a group of movie posters to get more details on selected poster. It also has a page that allows you to add a movie to the data base with a selection of genres to choose from. One of the problems that I had was figuring out how to use a dropdown method to be able to select from genres that were populating from the database. I first had to do some research how to write the code for a dropdown, I then had to make sure I had a reducer that was ready to populate the information that was being sent from the database on page load.





Prerequisites
Link to software that is required to install the app (e.g. node).
I used:
Javascript, Express, Axios, React, React-Redux, Redux-saga, Node.js
    



Installation
How do you get your application up and running? This is a step by step list for how another developer could get this project up and running. The good target audience in terms of knowledge, would be a fellow Primer from another cohort being able to spin up this project. Note that you do not need a paragraph here to intro Installation. It should be step-by-step.

TO start make a database named saga_movies_weekend that takes in the database.sql file.
Then run npm install
npm run server
npm run client

Thanks to Casie for being an excellent teacher! Thanks to Adam Boerhave to the supplementary help when I went to far down a rabbit hole.
